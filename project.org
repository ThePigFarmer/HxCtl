* Software
** Main controller
*** DONE remove the millis() timer from HydralicCircuit
*** DONE add hydralicCircuitsLastLoopTime
*** DONE make the alarm do its thing for case and charge pressure
*** DONE merge code in "test" into button library YES!
*** DONE make brightness button not toggle page
*** DONE split case and charge functions
*** DONE make charge beeper shut off after a second
*** DONE add startup timer to charge control
*** DONE clear bottom of lcd on refresh to avoid sorry 5345 psi case pressures when it is only 53 psi
*** DONE calculate the factor and test it
factor = 1.6 and min_in = 102.3
*** DONE make rawInToPSI
*** TODO test the rawInToPSI() implementation
*** TODO decide if we need float on any thing

* Hardware
** DONE build transistor circuit for beeper and wire it so it gets 9v instead of 5.
** DONE Buy or build a shield that will plug into mega2560 and have terminal blocks (screw)
** DONE get power regulated (just calculated that built in power regular will work)
** DONE debug lcd backlight driver
** DONE get solder out of connection
** DONE get resume switches ordered
** DONE design enclosure #consult.david
** DONE get bottom printed
** DONE get top piece printed
** DONE get front cover cut
** DONE see if we want bottom reprint
** DONE get standoffs and lcd seal designed
** DONE get them printed
** DONE cut plate
** TODO mount components
** TODO figure lcd position
** TODO attach switches
** TODO attach and lable wires
** TODO cut box down
** TODO test


* Sensor calibration
|------------------------+---------------|
| volt range             | 0 - 5         |
| arduino range          | 0 - 1023      |
|------------------------+---------------|
| sensor range (volt)    | .5 - 4.5      |
| sensor range (arduino) | 102.3 - 920.7 |
